..A glass of water.  A hand grabs it. I dream of Sailor Moon, usually. I wake up angry, someone was hitting me with a stick, over and over. I cannot help but get up underneath the pond. I imagine the reeds cover, and the indifferent water.

A thousand flesh bare animated dolls, accepting men and women around the world. Duck shit, absolutely everywhere. I walk the same path every day, and it does not get any cleaner. Some fucking kid chasing a swan, pisses me off. 

The kid's eyes were set back in his head, and a long triangular nose, he's grey-pored like a shark, tiny pins of hair grossly populate the scalp. 

Maybe I am angry. I'm being clipped by the fear of the world. 

Contorting faces now, helmed with plated clear raspberry steel, pink faced and sniffing the air, become a hundred shadows in coffee shop windows, a tiny tourist box. 

Today two ducks guard the center of the court and I walk around them, aiming to please any onlookers into thinking I'm some sort of environmental god - one in touch with his natural self, a respecter of all life. I know that my incapabilties and fear drive me more than my acceptance. I should stop pleasing onlookers.
